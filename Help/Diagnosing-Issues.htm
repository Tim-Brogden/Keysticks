            Keysticks has a Message Log window which displays real-time diagnostic information about
            the controller events that Keysticks detects and the actions it performs in your current session.
            To access the Message Log, choose 'View message log...' from the Keysticks main menu.
        </p>
        <div style="text-align:center;">
            <img alt="Message log - current session" src="Images/Message-log.jpg" style="margin:5px;" />
        </div>
        <p>
            The example above shows that the logging level is set to show error messages plus diagnostic information such as controller events and mouse and keyboard actions. There is also a logging level 'All' for logging
            additional debug information which may be useful to developers.
            Here, the user pressed Button 4 on their controller (the Y button) which triggered
            Keysticks to perform a left click then type the key combination Alt+Up. The two Source events
            at the beginning and end represent the physical press and release of the button. If you are trying
            to understand why your profile is not doing what you want, this is the first thing to look for:
            whether the controller events are being detected. If they are are not, you need to use the
            <a href="Profile-Designer-Inputs.htm" title="Profile Designer - Inputs">Inputs tab</a>
            of the Profile Designer window to check your controller is connected and mapped correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, the message log shows two Mouse Button State events representing the mouse down and mouse up events which
            make up a left click. The four Key events show the pressing down of Alt (which appears with the perhaps slightly 
            cryptic name 'Menu'),
            then Up, followed by the release of Up, then Alt. You will also see Keyboard State events appear when Keysticks
            changes the state of the modifier keys (Alt, Ctrl, Shift, Win) or the toggle keys (CapsLock, NumLock, ScrollLock, Insert).
            In this case, the keyboard state of "Menu, None" means the Alt modifier key is pressed down but no toggle keys are toggled on.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the actions you expected are being logged in the message log but nothing is happening in the application
            or game you are using, there could be a number of possible reasons for that. A common issue is that Keysticks
            does have the authority to send input to your application. This can sometimes be resolved by running Keysticks
            as Administrator. Another possible situation is when the application overrides what Keysticks is trying to do. For example,
            some games fix or hide the mouse cursor as part of their camera / movement functionality.
            Also, some games read their input at a lower level than Keysticks ('raw input')
            and therefore do not detect Keysticks actions. In these cases, unfortunately, there is nothing that can be done.
            Occasionally, you might find that some controls work but others do not. This can be the case when a particular
            key or key combination is already in use by the application or is mapped by another piece of software. In this case,
            see whether you can map a different key or key combination in your application and update your Keysticks profile
            accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can use the 'Save' button to save the log of your current session to a text file.
            Clicking 'Clear' clears the list, which is useful for starting afresh and analysing the next controller action you perform.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the (hopefully) rare occasions an error occurs in Keysticks or a warning is raised,
            the information is logged to the Keysticks log file,
            and the contents of that log can be viewed by selecting "Error history" in the Message Log window.
            Keysticks also briefly displays the error message in its title bar and shows a warning icon.
            Double clicking the icon opens the message log.
            In the error history view, the Message Details panel shows any additional technical information (such as the stack trace)
            which may help to diagnose the error. Clicking Clear
            deletes the log file but does not affect the current session view.
