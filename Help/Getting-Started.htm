        <p>
            Thank you for downloading Keysticks! Keysticks is a program that lets you control
            your Windows computer using Xbox 360 controllers, Xbox One controllers, joysticks and other game controllers.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are lots of ways to use Keysticks. For example, you can...
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create your own controls for PC games...</li>
            <li>Change the music playing on your laptop...</li>
            <li>Browse the web on your TV from the sofa...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            When Keysticks is running, it will automatically detect your controller when you plug it in. (If your controller isn't detected, check in the Windows Device Manager that you have the right drivers for it installed.) If you want to use an Xbox 360 controller, you can use either a wired controller plugged directly into a USB port, or a wireless controller with a Wireless Gaming Receiver plugged into a USB port (see picture below).              
        </p>
        <div style="text-align:center;">
            <img alt="Wireless controller and laptop" src="Images/Wireless-Music-Photo.JPG" style="margin:5px;"/>
        </div>
        <p>
            Once Keysticks is installed, you can start the program by:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Double-clicking the shortcut on your desktop</li>
            <li>Clicking the shortcut in your Start menu, under All Programs/Keysticks</li>
            <li>Double-clicking a Keysticks profile file</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            A "profile" is just a file that defines some controls 
            for your controller(s); in other words, what you want the controller(s) to do. 
            Keysticks comes with some ready-made profiles, and when you run Keysticks for the first time, 
            it will load profile P01 to get you started.
            You can also <a href="Downloading-Profiles.htm" title="Downloading profiles">download more profiles</a> that other users 
            have shared from within the software. It's useful to know that you can double-click profile files when Keysticks is already 
            running, as a way of quickly loading a different profile.
        </p>
        <div style="text-align:center;">
            <img alt="Desktop shortcut and profiles" src="Images/Desktop-shortcut-and-profiles.jpg" style="margin:5px;"/>
        </div>
        <p>
            When Keysticks is running, you'll see the controller window which is shaped like a game controller and shows you what the current controls are. This window has five menu buttons which, from left to right, are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Choose a profile</li>
            <li>Edit this profile</li>
            <li>Open the program menu (also pictured below)</li>
            <li>Program options</li>
            <li>Open this help file</li>
        </ul>
        <div style="text-align:center;">
            <img alt="Program menu" src="Images/Program-menu.jpg" style="margin:5px;"/>
        </div>
        <p>
            You can also access the program menu by right-clicking the controller image. You can close the controller window if you wish, once you're familiar with the controls: Keysticks will continue running in the background and you can access the program menu by clicking the 
            <img alt="Keysticks icon" src="Images/KLogo.png" /> icon in the system tray (bottom-right of your screen).
            You may have to click the arrow to unhide any hidden icons. To exit Keysticks, choose Exit from the program menu (see above).
        </p>

            Before we continue, it's worth mentioning that there's a Support area at <a href="http://keysticks.net" title="Go to Keysticks.net" target="_blank">Keysticks.net</a>
            where you can find the online help, FAQ, and more.
            Please take note of the following caution too:
        </p>
        <p>
            <img alt="Caution icon" src="Images/Error.png" class="headingImage" />
            <span>Take care while you are familiarising yourself with Keysticks controls, especially more powerful ones like Backspace, Delete, double-click, Start program, etc.            
It's a good idea to practise using a program like WordPad or a single-player game until you get the hang of things. Please follow the manufacturer's guidelines for using your controller (e.g. take regular rest breaks). If you plan to try Keysticks for health reasons, that's great to hear, but please seek medical advice first.
