            To start controlling your PC using Keysticks, you need to load a profile. A profile is a file which defines what you want your controller(s) to do. Keysticks runs one profile at a time, but profiles can contain controls for multiple applications and controllers.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you know which profile you want to use, you can simply double-click it. 
            To open the folder in which your profiles are stored, choose "Open profiles folder..." from the Keysticks program menu.
        </p>
        <div style="text-align:center;">
            <img alt="Desktop shortcut and profiles" src="Images/Desktop-shortcut-and-profiles.jpg" style="margin:5px;"/>
        </div>
        <p>
            Alternatively, you can click the "Choose a profile..." button in the controller window (or from the Keysticks program menu) to open the Profile Browser. Here you can browse your profiles and preview what the controls do. It's a good idea always to familiarise yourself with a profile's controls before using them. When you click "Load", the selected profile will be loaded and the controls in it will be applied. You can also double-click a profile in the My Profiles list to load it.
        </p>
        <div style="text-align:center;">
            <img alt="Choose a profile" src="Images/Choose-a-profile.jpg" style="margin:5px;"/>
        </div>
        <p>
            The Profile Browser also has a "Download Area" tab which allows you to download profiles that other users have shared. We'll come back to that in the <a href="Downloading-Profiles.htm" title="Downloading profiles">Downloading profiles</a> topic.
